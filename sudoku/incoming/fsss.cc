A Fast Simple Sudoku Solver by Mladen Dobrichev

For commercial users the actions allowed to this file are limited to erasing.
No limitations to other users, but citing somewhere my name is welcome.
There are parts of code taken from bb_sudoku by Brian Turner. Thank you, Brian!

The entry point is
	int solve(char* in, char* out, int mode).

Compiler flags:
-c -O2 -Ob1 -Oi -Ot -Oy -GA -MT -GS- -GR- -Wp64 -Gr
-Qopenmp -Qftz -QxSSE2 -Qopenmp-link:static
Which means:
compile_only, optimize_for_speed, expands_only_functions_marked_as_inline,
use_intrinsic_functions, favor_fast_code, omit_frame_pointers, fast_access_to_tls_storage,
multithreaded_executable, no_buffer_security_check, disable_runtime_type_info,
detect_64-bit_portability_issues, use__fastcall_calling_convention,
generate_parallel_code, flush_denormal_fp_result_to_zero, use_SSE2_instructions,
link_statically_to_openmp

Some counterintuitive compilation hints:
- no global optimizations, only for speed
- no inlining
- no interprocedural optimizations
- no Profile Guided Optimizations

Therminology:
"Game" is the puzzle along with the whole context during processing.
Puzzle consist of 81 "Cells".
Each cell is member of three "Groups" - its "Row", "Column", and "Square".
The rest of the cells within the same row, column, and square are "Affected Cells".
Segment is a combination of first/second/third three rows or columns.
"Triplets" are first/second/third subsequent 3 cells within the rows and columns.
"Affected Triplets" for a given triplet are the rest of the triplets in the same row/col and square.

//No global variables
//No runtime integer division or multiplication
//Runtime Library function calls are limited to memcpy (hidden, when assigning the game struct), setjmp, and longjmp.

//There is an Intel Compiler specific pragma "unroll" which causes significant improvement in the SetDigit function.
//It is critical this loop to be unrolled to obtain good performance. Splitting the loop into chunks
//may cause other compilers to unroll them. Last resort is manual unrolling.

/***************************************************************************
A Fast Simple Sudoku Solver by Mladen Dobrichev

This is a simple file created to demonstrate:
1. Usage of "solve" function defined in file game.cpp.
2. Parallel processing using OpemMP package. (/Qopenmp /Qopenmp-link:static)
The file does not share either preprocess directives nor global variables
with game.cpp, which is the actual solver.
It has been tested only with MS VS 2005.

For commercial users the actions allowed to this file are limited to erasing.
No limitations to other users, but citing somewhere my name is welcome.
