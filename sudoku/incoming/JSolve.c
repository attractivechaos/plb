	Take a chute (three blocks in a line), named by the lowest numbered house that it
	contains, and divide it up into 9 strips, each with 3 cells in the intersection of a
	line and a block.
	
	Each strip has four neighboring strips, which share either a line or a block with it.
	These divide into two pairs of two strips, each pair making up the strips that share a
	single house with the original strip. For example, strip A in the diagram above shares
	a block with strips D and G, and shares a line with strips B and C.

	If one of the pairs of neighboring strips (BC or DG) is missing a digit, which is
	contained in the original strip, we have a locked candidate. The candidate is locked
	to the original strip and can not appear in any of the four neighbors. If the other
	paid of neighboring strips contains that digit, we have an elimination.

	This routine is based on looking for candidates that occur in the primary strip and
	one pair of neighboring strips, but not int the other pair of neighboring strips. When
	that happens there is an elimination to be made. This can easily be calculated for all
	digits at once using bitwise operations on words.
